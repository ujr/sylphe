Qbist tasks and ideas
=====================

  x  Layout and style using CSS (try w3.css)
  x  Anti aliasing (checkbox) by oversampling
  x  Optimize qbist (see my old method and verify)
  x  Modify (or clear) name on variate/random
  x  Export to (high resolution) PNG file (toDataUrl/toBlob)
  x  Export to save file for GIMP's qbist plugin
  x  Wait cursor while rendering (via setTimeout)
  x  History and undo
  x  Color scheme (just grays) for w3.css
  x  Style the antialias checkbox
  x  Delete and rename saved qbists
  x  Export and import qbist parameters
  x  Let user choose size for exported PNG/JPEG
  x  Coding style: decide on and adhere to some guidelines
  x  Review all presets, keep only the "better" half
  o  Tune for responsiveness / improve for small screens


Web Dev Knowledge

  Include scripts in head or body? Why?
   - HTML parsing stops while scripts are loaded!
   - load scripts towards the end of the HTML
   - or use the HTML5 async or defer attributes

  Redraw DOM during long running JS function?
   - avoid long-running JS functions!
   - most browsers redraw only after JS returned
   - work around using setTimeout() or setInterval()

  Gotchas:
   - history is unavailable as a global variable name: because it is
     the read-only window.history property that represents Browser history
